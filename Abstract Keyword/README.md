## The “abstract” Keyword

1. The keyword abstract can be used on class declaration. For example abstract MyClassX (…);.
1. The keyword abstract can be used on method declaration. For example abstract int f (…);.
1. When a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.
1. When a method is declared abstract, it cannot have definition.
1. Only abstract classes can have abstract methods. Abstract class does not necessarily require its methods to be all abstract.

## Purpose of Abstract Classes

The purpose of abstract class is to serve purely as a parent of classes. (that is, solely for the purpose of extension (inheritance) by other classes.)

The difference between abstract class and “normal” class is that, the abstract class's methods cannot have any definition.
