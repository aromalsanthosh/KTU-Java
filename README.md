# Made with ❤ by yours truly 

# Acknowledgement
I would like to start by thanking my teacher Ms.Divya John for giving me the best introduction to the Java world.

# Introduction
This repo consists of my work on Java and the simple programs which i had done inorder to learn Java.  

To be specific my aim was to familiarize with the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University's (initially Kerala Technological University(KTU)) [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ojglPaasIEUUFuSVRXbDlZTEk/view) for Java.  

Created this repository with the aim of helping out my friends and others to understand the basics of Java and to understand its scope by doing some programs. 

# Requirements
1. Java SE Development Kit(JDK) --> [Install JDK](https://www.codenotfound.com/java-download-install-jdk-8-windows.html)
1. For coding make use of IDEs like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html#section=linux)  
   or Text Editors like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)  
   or the classic and powerful command line editor [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) which i use. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

# How to use my repositiory? 
Assuming that you've already installed the above requirements and it is in a working condition. Then:-    
1. Fork the repository(optional)
1. Clone/Download the files into your local machine  
   ###### For Linux Users :-  
   [Set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) in your local machine  
   Then from command line create a clone in your local machine by:-  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yedhink/KTU-Java.git
   ```

# What's next?
Now what you waiting for? Compile all the `*.java` files and run it.  

If you're using an IDE like Intellij then i suggest you follow this [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2017.1/creating-running-and-packaging-your-first-java-application.html).  

For all others, the most easiest way would be to fire up your Terminal Emulator or Command Line(cmd) for Windows users and change directory (eg:- cd S3CsSgpa) into the one of the directories in my repo.  

Then compile into the same directory (which the "." represents) by:

```bash
javac -d . *.java
```

After creating the compiled .class file, just run it using (avoid the .class extension):

```bash
java classWhichConsistsOfMainMethod
```

What if it's part of a Package? No problemo. After compiling, run:

```bash
java nameOfPackage.filename
```
